## Overview
Welcome to the github repository for the codebase for the family business. This is a static website that hosts public information for a pool hall and tavern located in Corona, NY:
- Hours of operations
- What the establishment is about
- Gallery of photos
- Promotions
- Menu

This website was created with the purpose of having an official website through which visitors can learn more about what is offered in the establishment/ Recurring visitors may also come here to learn about the latest promotions we offer for the clientele. In recent years, we have noticed an influx of people, many of whom found our business through google. We decided it would be best to supplement our google business page with a custom made website to showcase what the business offers: A warm, welcoming atmosphere for people to enjoy pool table games and drink together with friends.

## What's New? (As of 11/18/2024)
- Finally finished the first version of the website and now hosted the site on Google Firebase. 
- This marks my first time that I have used Google Cloud for hosting and learned how to set up my project for firebase hosting. 
- This project is also the first time I have ever used TypeScript and TailwindCSS for type checking and flexible styling respectively. I am looking to continue using TailwindCSS for future projects. TypeScript also allowed me to structure my data, saving me a lot of headaches.
- Implemented SEO optimizations (Lazy loading, .webp files, added height and width dimensions to gallery pictures, aria-labels). 
## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI
- Google Cloud (Firebase)
